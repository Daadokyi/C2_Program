**Development Environment and Compilation Guide**

This README file provides information on the development environment and instructions for compiling and running the C source code implementing the given piecewise recurrence relation F(n) = F(n-3) + F(n-2) with F(0) = 0, F(1) = 1, and F(2) = 2.

**Development Environment:**

To develop and run the C code, you need the following tools installed on your system:

1. C Compiler: The code is written in C, so you'll need a C compiler such as GCC (GNU Compiler Collection) or Clang.

2. Text Editor or Integrated Development Environment (IDE): Use a text editor like Visual Studio Code, Sublime Text, or an IDE like Code::Blocks, Dev-C++, or Xcode (for macOS) to edit and write the code.

**Source Code:**

Here is the C code for the three different approaches to implement the piecewise recurrence relation:

1. Recursive Approach (`fibonacci_recursive.c`):

```c
#include <stdio.h>

int fibonacciRecursive(int n) {
    if (n == 0) return 0;
    if (n == 1) return 1;
    if (n == 2) return 2;
    return fibonacciRecursive(n - 3) + fibonacciRecursive(n - 2);
}

int main() {
    int n = 10; // Replace with your desired value of n
    int result = fibonacciRecursive(n);
    printf("F(%d) = %d\n", n, result);
    return 0;
}
```

2. Iterative Approach (`fibonacci_iterative.c`):

```c
#include <stdio.h>

int fibonacciIterative(int n) {
    if (n == 0) return 0;
    if (n == 1) return 1;
    if (n == 2) return 2;

    int a = 0, b = 1, c = 2, d;
    for (int i = 3; i <= n; i++) {
        d = c + b;
        a = b;
        b = c;
        c = d;
    }
    return d;
}

int main() {
    int n = 10; // Replace with your desired value of n
    int result = fibonacciIterative(n);
    printf("F(%d) = %d\n", n, result);
    return 0;
}
```

3. Memoization Approach (`fibonacci_memoization.c`):

```c
#include <stdio.h>

int memo[100]; // Assuming n will be less than or equal to the maximum integer value

int fibonacciMemoization(int n) {
    if (n == 0) return 0;
    if (n == 1) return 1;
    if (n == 2) return 2;
    
    if (memo[n] != 0) return memo[n];
    
    memo[n] = fibonacciMemoization(n - 3) + fibonacciMemoization(n - 2);
    return memo[n];
}

int main() {
    int n = 10; // Replace with your desired value of n
    int result = fibonacciMemoization(n);
    printf("F(%d) = %d\n", n, result);
    return 0;
}
```

**Compilation and Execution:**

To compile and run the source code, follow these steps:

1. Open a text editor or IDE and create a new C file for one of the three approaches (`fibonacci_recursive.c`, `fibonacci_iterative.c`, or `fibonacci_memoization.c`).

2. Copy the code for the corresponding approach into the C file.

3. Save the file.

4. Open a terminal or command prompt on your system.

5. Navigate to the directory where you saved the C file using the `cd` command.

6. To compile the C code, use the appropriate compiler command. For GCC, run the following command:

```
gcc -o fibonacci fibonacci_recursive.c // Replace with the appropriate filename for iterative or memoization approach
```

The `-o` flag specifies the output file name, which is `fibonacci` in this case. You can replace `fibonacci` with any desired name for the executable.

7. To run the compiled program, use the following command:

```
./fibonacci
```

Replace `fibonacci` with the name you provided during compilation.

8. The program will run and display the result for the given value of `n`.

**Note:**

- Make sure you have a C compiler and a suitable text editor or IDE installed on your system before proceeding with the development.

- The instructions in this README assume you are using a Unix-like system (e.g., Linux, macOS). If you are using Windows, you can use a terminal emulator like Git Bash or PowerShell to run the commands.

- This README assumes you are familiar with basic C programming concepts and have a basic understanding of using the terminal or command prompt.
